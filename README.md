## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this project, the key thing I have learnt is to apply media queries to make the components change their orientation with size, as well as familiarizing myself with the "cascading" markup of CSS. Specifically, having the ":hover" pseudo-property come after listing all default button properties.

### Continued development

I found myself not as familiar with using classes and/or ids on specifying components to change when I tried to customize the button colors, both hovered or not.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This page provided reference for much of the syntax.
